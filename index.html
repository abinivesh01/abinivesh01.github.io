<h1> HISTORY</h1>
       
<p style= "margin-left:2.5em">The company's origins date back to 1865, when a Limoges porcelain (in France's Limousin region) workshop was set up on the route to Lyon originally making porcelain dishes. In 1904, the company was taken over by Frédéric Legrand, who gave his name to the company. In 1919, the company entered into partnership with Jean Mondot, an artisan from Limoges who had started, a small factory, in Exideuil making electric switches using porcelain and boxwood.
